	<p>I'm a 30 year old former (resigned in March) civil engineer looking for a sea change. IT seemed the obvious choice given my affinity for computers and all manner of gadgets.</p>
	<p>My education to date includes multiple primary and secondary schools along the Australian east coast (we moved a lot due to my parents' work) and a civil engineering degree from La Trobe University, class of 2013. Over to the right there you can see me after receiving my civil engineering diploma... except they hadn't printed my mine yet and just gave me this sample one instead. They did eventually print it and mailed it to me but I prefer this one.</p>
	<p>Along with moving and changing schools frequently, my parents' work also took our family overseas several times all through our schooling. In later high school, to minimise disruption to our study, my brother and I went to boarding school, only going overseas with our parents during the holidays.</p>
	<p>Other tremendously interesting 'Murray' themed trivia can be found on the other pages.</p>
