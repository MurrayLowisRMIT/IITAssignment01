	<h3>16 Personalities - Myers-Briggs test</h3>
	
	<img src="Images/16 Personalities result.png">
	
	<p><strong>INTP-T - Logician</strong></p>
	
	<p>This result demonstrates particularly strong introversion as well as a preference for theoretical and rational thinking as opposed to practical or emotional thinking.</p>
	<p>In a team environment, logicians' intuitive (N) and prospecting (P) traits lead to focus on exploring every possibility and testing new ideas rather than unilateral decision making. This can be beneficial to a team in coming up with creative solutions to problems but can also have the disadvantage of time wasted on excessive deliberating or pursuing impractical goals.</p>
	<p>The introverted (I) trait means logicians prefer to carry out the bulk of their workload alone, using team mates more for brainstorming or to help troubleshoot a problem. While this grants a level of independence, it also creates potential for a disconnect with overall team objectives which can be avoided with casual regular check ins with teammates.</p>
	<p>The thinking (T) trait entails a logical (rather than emotional) approach to situations. While an advantage when handling logical challenges, it can also lead to conflict within teams due to a lack of empathy or consideration for others' ideas or values.</p>
	<p>To make full use of the logician skill set it can be effective to pair with a more pragmatic team member such as those with the judging (J) trait. This will help capture good ideas and but also keep the focus on the task at hand instead of allowing excessive deliberating to waste time.</p>

	<h3>Mint HR - Learning style test</h3>
	
	<p>
	<strong>
		Reflector: 18/20<br>
		Theorist: 15/20<br>
		Pragmatist: 8/20<br>
		Activist: 8/20<br>
	</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>This result aligns with the Myers-Briggs 'logician' result, reiterating the preference to observe and analyse. New tasks are best approached by taking a process apart piece by piece and testing each step along the way.</p>
	<p>This means that when handling something new, additional time should be allocated to explore in greater depth and understand every step along the way. Skimming details or being forced to simply accept facts without explanation could lead to apprehension in following conventional methods.</p>
	<p>Reflective/theoretical learners are therefore likely to have a good understanding of the fundamentals which can be used to devise creative new solutions, however this may come at the cost of difficulty working within predefined customs.</p>
	<p>In a team, such individuals may benefit from working on narrower yet less explored areas of a topic where there are likely to be fewer inhibiting predefined conventions. This will allow them to take advantage of their understanding of fundamentals to solve problems in creative ways others may not have the patience for.</p>

	<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
	
	<p>
	<strong>
		Openness to experience: 51%<br>
		Conscientiousness: 29%<br>
		Extraversion: 1%<br>
		Agreeableness: 46%<br>
		Natural reactions: 47%<br>
	</strong>
	</p>

	<p>These results show generally middle of the road attitudes with the exceptions of below average conscientiousness and extremely low extraversion.</p>
	<p>As with results from the previous tests, low extraversion suggests a preference for solitary working conditions ideally tempered with routine check ins with team members.</p>
	<p>Low conscientiousness reinforces a preference for freedom or flexibility and an aversion to stifling conventions.</p>
