	<h1>ITT Assignment 01</h1>
	<h2>Section 2 - Interest in IT</h2>
	
	<p>My interest in IT started with the escape that video games provided when I was a kid. I did not really gain any actual aptitude with computers until getting a laptop at 15 at which point my new hobby became playing with every possible facet of my new computer. This led to a lot of meddling, breaking, repairing and overall fascination with computers. Other than continuous meddling with my own gadgets and being the de facto tech support guy for friends and family, the only reputable experience I have with IT is having completed a few online programming courses for fun.</p>
	<p>My decision to study IT at RMIT was mostly influenced by the course guides offered at Online Universities Australia when I was researching the subject several months ago, combined with the general knowledge that RMIT is a well respected institution. The story doesn't really get much more interesting than that however.</p>
	<p>While I have learnt to temper my expectations, I currently hope that I'll eventually be able to earn a career in software development or in cyber security. Although with admittedly limited basis for the assumption, I get the impression that it can be difficult to make a successful career in certain tech roles which is why I aim to keep my goals as broad as possible until I can make a better informed decision as I progress through this course.</p>
	<p>By the end of this course I hope to have a more specific understanding of options available to me, and to use this course and elective subjects as a stepping stone into a fulfilling career.</p>
