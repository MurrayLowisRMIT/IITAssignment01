	<p>This is an example of a software engineer job listing with a tech company specialising in customised software for its clients. In addition to producing and marketing their own software they also provide ongoing support with onboarding and rolling out updates based on client feedback. The role itself requires familiarity with several programming languages, and the ability to interact constructively with both clients and colleagues, to identify ways to improve their product.</p>
	<p>The role interests me as it sounds like it will allow a degree of creative freedom in software design. A set list of outcomes is provided by the company itself or by a client, a general set of programming guidelines is set out for streamlining integration with the work of others, otherwise the design approach is at the discretion of the software engineer. Creative freedom is one of the things I am most interested in when it comes to advancing my IT career and as such this could be a fitting role.</p>
	<p>This role would require developing fluency in a range of programming languages as a starting point, and the drive to continue exploring them and developing smarter solutions. It also requires the ability to communicate constructively with clients and colleagues to figure out new ways to improve their product.</p>
	<p>Experience from my education and previous career in engineering/project management gives me a good starting point for the requisite communication skills for this role. My previous communication experience however has been more tailored towards conveying information rather than a two-way exchange. I will need to continue to build and use receptive communication skills to meet the requirements of such a position. Naturally, this position would also require a great deal of study into programming languages and techniques. I hope to further build on both skill groups through course material and cooperative group work within this course, as well as over the course of any undergraduate and post-graduate work experience. Short term undergraduate work, casual work or even freelance projects could also help provide experience to bolster my application.</p>
