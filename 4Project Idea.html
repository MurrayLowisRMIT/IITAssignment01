	<h2>Section 5 - Project Idea: Aquarium Climate Control System</h2>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>My project idea is to develop a full climate control system for household aquariums. This system would incorporate several mechanisms and sensors used together to gauge and maintain the biological health of an aquarium, as well as interactive software to provide relevant information to the user.</p>
	<p>The mechanical systems would potentially include heaters, filters, lights, timers, reservoirs, and aerators all configurable to maintain water parameters set by the user based on the needs of their tank. These would interface with various sensors in the tank measuring parameters such as temperature, water level, and water chemistry. Integrating these systems will allow a tank to manage these parameters on its own and to otherwise provide feedback to the user through the integrated software.</p>
	<p>Supporting this software would be a sort of digital encyclopedia covering appropriate parameters for all manner of different tank species and set up types to inform the user on the best approaches available.</p>
	
	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>Having owned multiple aquariums over several years and trying various types of set ups, I have found that there are many ways to successfully maintain an aquarium. More to the point however, there are many ways to poorly maintain an aquarium, leading to unhealthy tank conditions and stress, sickness, or death for its inhabitants.</p>
	<p>One of the main causes of poorly maintained tanks is user ignorance. Very often aquariums become unhealthy simply because its carer does not understand the needs of their tank or tries to combine incompatible tank mates.</p>
	<p>Having a system that provides all the information up front to a user will allow them to make informed decisions about what livestock their set up can support, as well as how to manage the system once itâ€™s up and running. Alternatively, it can be used as a guide for how to set up a tank to accommodate desired species.</p>
	<p>Another cause of poor aquarium conditions is the sheer effort required for proper maintenance. Having a system to automate many of these responsibilities and otherwise advise the user when their input is required will greatly ease their workload and streamline maintenance.</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This project is built around two central components: the physical hub installed into the aquarium onto which all the other modules would be connected, and the encyclopaedic software to allow the user to plan/manage their aquarium and provide feedback on tank conditions.</p>
	<p>The hub would be a custom designed computer with several multipurpose ports to allow for the docking of the different modules that both measure and alter the tank parameters. The most fundamental of these modules would be a water heater and thermometer which no aquarium should be without regardless. Different sizes of heaters would need to be available for different tank sizes and types. Other optional modules could be bundled with the hub or come separately depending on the nature of the set up the user desired.</p>

	<p>A filter is the second most fundamental piece of equipment. A filter can be omitted in more advanced set ups if the tank is very heavily planted and houses bottom feeding livestock like shrimp, snails or catfish allowing the tank to biologically filter itself, or if the user performs very frequent water changes (not an ideal scenario howevever, as frequent water changes tend to create stressful conditions and deprive the tank of healthy bacteria etc.). Where filters are used, sensors could be connected to measure water parameters to toggle the filter on and off depending on water hygiene. Keeping filters off when not needed will reduce drain on beneficial bacteria and help maintain food supply for plants and bottom feeders.</p>
	<p>An aerator (which could be combined with a filter if used in a continuously running environment) can be paired with water level sensors to gauge the flow rate. A lower water level means greater energy in the water falling from waterfall type aerators, requiring lower discharge for the same aeration. Automating this would help, as too much aeration can cause health problems for many species and create excessive noise. Another optional addition to this would be automated water reservoirs or ballast tanks to counter evaporated water and maintain the water level.</p>
	<p>Proper lighting is essential for strong growth in planted tanks and can easily be combined with timers and sensors for several parameters like light intensity received on the tank floor and algae growth (too much light will result in algal blooms). Combining these features will allow the system to set appropriate lighting intensity and intervals to maintain balance between all these factors, and could be adjustable depending on the orientation of the tank and species housed.</p>
	<p>Other water chemistry parameters such as pH and water hardness (dissolved minerals) can be monitored easily enough with appropriate sensors. These conditions can then either regulated with automatic chemical release systems or provided as feedback to the user to intervene manually.</p>
	<p>Several of these systems could be readily interchangeable with generic 3rd party appliances like lights, aerators, and heaters as these can be simply toggled on and off as necessary with a power switch. Other systems however such as chemistry regulators would require entirely unique mechanisms and so the user would be either limited to using these specific modules or otherwise intervening manually.</p>
	<p>These gadgets would be supported by the software package which could be made available as a smartphone app or computer program. This could either be a standalone piece of software that simply acts like an encyclopaedia, providing information on everything from tank set up methodologies to species requirements and compatibility, to an interface that connects wirelessly with the fish tank hub providing real time feedback on tank conditions and requirements. This software could also be incorporated into the hub itself via a touchscreen user interface allowing the entire system to controlled and monitored from a single intuitive location.</p>
	<p>The modular design of this project also means that there would be the option of expanding functionality to cover new modules as they are conceived.</p>

	<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
	<p>This project would require employing both programming and engineering principles to construct and configure the hub, the sensors, and the mechanical systems. Many of the systems involved in this would be simply derived from existing technologies including most of the physical gadgets, many of the sensors, and the encyclopaedic premise of the supporting software. The hub itself could be built upon existing portable CPU technology like the Raspberry Pi.</p>
	<p>Other components however would require less readily available technology such as mechanical sensors for algal growth and certain water parameters which traditionally are measured with manual chemistry sets and visual inspection etc. These tools would need to be developed alongside this project before they could be implemented.</p>

	<h3>Skills Required</h3>
	<p>The software component of this project would require expertise in the programming of both computer apps and to a degree robotics. The system needs to be intuitively controllable by the user through either the separate app or as an interface on the hub itself, both of which would require the creation of custom software. The mechanical systems would also need to be programmed to perform the required behaviours such as toggling modules on and off, or varying outputs based on readings from the sensors.</p>
	<p>The hardware components would require electrical engineering or robotics expertise to design and construct the main hub as well as several of the modules such as chemical release systems or mechanical ballast systems.</p>

	<h3>Outcome</h3>
	<p>This project would improve the capability of novice aquarium owners to maintain healthy tank conditions. Automating many of the manual obligations in conjunction with the information provided by the app would also enable them to try many of the more sophisticated types of aquarium builds.</p>
	<p>For more invested enthusiasts, the automation would help to save time on the more menial tasks such as regular manual testing and allow them to focus more on the more exciting aspects of the hobby like aqua-scaping or breeding. It will also help mitigate deterioration when other obligations get in the way of tank maintenance. The app could also be used as a source of inspiration for new and interesting aquarium ideas.</p>
